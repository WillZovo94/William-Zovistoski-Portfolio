# William-Zovistoski-Portfolio

## Description
 - My motivation for building this project was to learn how to construct my own website design and layout to implement a responsive portfolio project. This portfolio project includes a responsive design, CSS custom artwork and animation, a accessible navigation bar with a smooth scrolling function, interactive links to various different contacts for contacting, along with clean-up code.
 - This helps solve my problem with not having a portfolio to showcase and demonstrate future projects. As well as learning CSS art and animation as an extra.
 - I learned the importance of layout design and proper links to help create a functional responsive website that presents you with key points of the webpage.

## Usage
- You have accessible navigation bar on the top right that will smoothly transition to the sections selected, along with a link that will access a PDF file within the repository to showcase my resume.
- Interactive CSS custom art and animation for some diversity to the page.
- Interactive section names that are changed while you hover over them.
- Links on the footer of the page that will present new information on how to contact using a new tab.
- Following image shows a section of the main webpage.
